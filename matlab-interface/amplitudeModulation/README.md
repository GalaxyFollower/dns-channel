### Quantification of the amplitude modulation

File description:

+ *envl.mat* : Method as outlined in Eq. (24) and (25) of Agostini, Leschziner &  
     Gaitonde, Phys. Fluids 28, 015110 (2016), also described in Figure 16 of  
     the same paper. 
+ *envl_mathis.mat* : Method as outlined in Figure 4 of Mathis, Hutchins & Marusic,  
     J. Fluid Mech.,628, 311-337 (2009)
+ *covariance.mat* : An example script for computing covariance estimator of amplitude  
     modulation, i.e. the covariance between the envelope of the small scales and the  
     large scale signal at two different wall-normal heights
+ *main.mat* : An example script for computing and plotting the envelopes with both  
     available methods, using both low-pass filtering in the spanwise or time directions
